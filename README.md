# Employee Management API

This is a simple REST API for managing employees, allowing for batch import of employee data from CSV files and supporting basic CRUD operations. The project is built with Laravel and uses MySQL/MariaDB for data storage.

## Prerequisites

- PHP 8.0+
- Composer
- MySQL/MariaDB
- [DDEV](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) (optional, can use other development environments)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DiamantElezi/testproject
cd testproject

if you use ddev 
ddev config (
projectname - 
Docroot Location - leave default to public
Project type - laravel)

ddev get ddev/ddev-phpmyadmin 
ddev start 
```
### Step 2: Install Dependencies
```bash
composer install
```
### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

Copy the .env.example to .env and configure the following environment variables:

Note this db configurations use only if you use ddev if not you can add it as the other development enviorment needs

```bash
APP_URL = testproject.ddev.site  // or if you added other name write as the url u need

DB_CONNECTION="mysql"
DB_HOST="db"
DB_PORT="3306"
